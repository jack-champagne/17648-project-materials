\section{Implementation Plan}
\subsection{Milestone 2 - Vehicle API (VAPI)}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
    \item Set up a base image and environment
    \item Implement single spoofed sensor
    \item Define data format based on project document (Vehicle Parameters of Interest)
    \item Define basic interface for which data will be sent ``off-vehicle.''
    \item Define relevant transfer functions (to be discussed on a later class) for sensor data to pre-processed before being sent.
    \item Use a push architecture to send data periodically in a test scenario
    \item Test system by creating some logs while vehicle parameters of interest vary over time
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Milestone 3 - Gateway}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
    \item Observe other gateways (possibly ones that I have worked with in the past)
    \item Define barebones ``needs'' and capabilities for this gateway
    \item Implement recieving messages from VAPI (push architecture)
    \item Implement forwarding messages to cloud broker
    \item Test gateway sending data to a remote cloud server (remote server just ``eats'' the data, does nothing with it yet
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Milestone 4 - Message Broker}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
    \item Read others usages of MQTT (Mosquitto) message broker including usage in docker containers / VMs.
    \item Implement a simple MQTT service by doing the following
    \item Get a publisher to attach to MQTT topic
    \item Get a client to subscribe to MQTT topic
    \item Successfully publish a message (and thus use the pub. sub. architecture of MQTT that is built in
    \item Try hooking up with gateway to publish some messages that the gateway could forward from the vehicle
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Milestone 5 - Database and Dashboard \textbf{Possible Project Extension}}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
    \item Deploy a Prometheus instance and Grafana instance to own hardware
    \item Configure services to be accessible over the web (via my own domain name)
    \item Test Prometheus + Grafana's capabilities by generating some canned data
    \item Subscribe the Prometheus metric management to the MQTT gateway and prepare to receive messages from vehicles.
    \item Test sending a sensor data message from the vehicle, to gateway, to broker, to Prometheus instance
    \item View test data from Grafana instance
    \item These services must run on a physically separate machine and must receive all of their communications over the internet.
    \item Extra deliverable here: Document setup and provisioning of hardware (hypervisors, container management, (some of) the networking within reason to document the system.
\end{itemize}
