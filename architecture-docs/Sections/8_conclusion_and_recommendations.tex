\section{Conclusion and Recommendations}

In conclusion, this document describes the architecture, the methodology to achieve said features, the Software BOM, and the component descriptions needed to start building out the pieces of software.

I recommend going forward with a ``push'' architecture system with a simple gateway, on-vehicle pre-processing, and a Mosquitto+Prometheus+Grafana backend in the cloud to ensure vehicle metrics are available anywhere and at all times.
