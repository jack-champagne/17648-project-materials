\section{Explanation of Results}

For each of these milestones, appropriate code will be made clearly available and easy to run and verify via reading the README of the repository and running the delineated commands. Some basic checks will be automatically run to ensure that certain functions of the system are working and described functionality can be achieved. For relevant milestones, they will include a demo that meets the requirements of what is desired.

I decided this architecture based on what I would reasonably implement as on a small team give the time resources and information that the company has given us to design such a system. Further work can be done in a number of areas but that is left open as more information on certain quality attributes could help in the department.
