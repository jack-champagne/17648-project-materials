\section{Executive Summary}
This project aims to deliver a high-reliability onsite+cloud provisioned software system to monitor, provide metrics, and provide alerts for mining vehicles in day-to-day operations. Given this data, pre-emptive maintenance checks can be run to ensure vehicles are running reliably with little downtime, and thus higher productivity is achieved.

To do this, we propose having the vehicle publish a number of parameters of interest so that they may be logged, monitored, queried, and understood in service of determining when maintenance may soon become necessary. Vehicles will report this data over the internet, and it will be logged in the cloud for later access, analysis, and the generation of metric alerts all available and configurable via a powerful but fairly easy-to-use visualization tool.
